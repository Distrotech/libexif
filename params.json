{"name":"Libexif","tagline":"","body":"\t\t\t\t    libexif\r\n\t\t\t\t    -------\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nlibexif is a library for parsing, editing, and saving EXIF data. It is\r\nintended to replace lots of redundant implementations in command-line\r\nutilities and programs with GUIs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n--------\r\n\r\nlibexif supports parsing, editing and saving of EXIF data. In addition, it\r\nhas gettext support. All EXIF tags described in EXIF standard 2.1 (and most\r\nfrom 2.2) are supported.  Many maker notes from Canon, Casio, Epson,\r\nFuji, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax and Sanyo cameras are also supported.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n------------\r\n\r\nlibexif is written in plain C and does not require any additional library.\r\nGNU gettext will be used for language translation, if available.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMITATIONS\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nlibexif can only handle some maker notes, and even those not very well. More\r\nwork needs to be done. Note that libmnote has been merged with libexif - it\r\nis no longer needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSAGE\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWe have documented the libexif API using doxygen and are making\r\nthe results available at http://libexif.sourceforge.net/api/\r\n\r\nThe short test programs in the test directory illustrates how to create\r\nvalid EXIF data from scratch, how to save EXIF data and how to load EXIF\r\ndata from data in memory. There are also a few simple example programs\r\navailable in the contrib/examples/ directory.  Don't hesitate to contact\r\nus at <libexif-devel@lists.sourceforge.net> if you have any questions\r\non how to use libexif.\r\n\r\nTo link to libexif into your own package, we recommend using the\r\npkgconfig utility (cf. http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/ For\r\nyour convenience, libexif both provides libexif-uninstalled.pc and\r\ninstalls libexif.pc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRONTENDS\r\n---------\r\n\r\nRight now, I know of the following frontends to libexif:\r\n - exif:     A small command-line utility to show EXIF information in JPEG\r\n             files (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif).\r\n - gexif:    A GTK+ frontend for editing EXIF data\r\n             (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif).\r\n - gphoto2:  A command-line frontend to libgphoto2, a library to access a \r\n             wide range of digital cameras (http://www.gphoto.org).\r\n - gtkam:    A GTK+ frontend to libgphoto2 (http://www.gphoto.org).\r\n - thirdeye: Digital photos organizer and driver for eComStation\r\n             (http://ecomstation.ru/thirdeye).\r\n - digikam:  digital photo management application for KDE\r\n             (http://www.digikam.org/)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to migrate your program to use libexif or add EXIF support\r\nto it, don't hesitate to contact the authors.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRARIES\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI know of the following libraries that use or have been inspired by libexif:\r\n - libexif-gtk: library of widgets to help display EXIF tags in GTK\r\n   programs (part of the libexif project)\r\n - pel: PHP-Code (http://pel.sourceforge.net)\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIt really depends on your environment what to do in order to get libexif\r\nto build. Building from the source tar ball usually involves the commands:\r\n\r\n  ./configure\r\n  make\r\n  sudo make install\r\n\r\nWhen building from source out of CVS, something like the following will be\r\nnecessary:\r\n\r\n  gettextize\r\n  mv po/Makevars.template po/Makevars\r\n  aclocal -I auto-m4 -I m4m\r\n  autoheader\r\n  libtoolize --force\r\n  automake --add-missing\r\n  autoconf\r\n  ./configure\r\n  make\r\n\r\nOr, probably just:\r\n\r\n  autoreconf -i\r\n  ./configure\r\n  make\r\n\r\nBesides the standard arguments, configure takes several specific to libexif:\r\n\r\n  --disable-docs          To disable producing any documentation\r\n  --enable-internal-docs  Build internal code docs if Doxygen available\r\n  --enable-ship-binaries  To include Windows DLLs in 'make dist'\r\n\r\nCertain specialized applications can reduce the size of the libexif\r\nbinary by setting one or both of the following macros in the CPPFLAGS\r\nenvironment variable at configure time.  Each one removes certain kinds of\r\ntext strings and constants from the binary.  Applications which need\r\nto access specific, known EXIF tags and know in advance the meaning of\r\ntheir data have no need of those strings and can save considerable space\r\nby eliminating them.\r\n\r\n -DNO_VERBOSE_TAG_STRINGS Names and descriptions of EXIF tags, debug messages,\r\n                          mandatory EXIF fields (disabling auto-tag-fixup)\r\n -DNO_VERBOSE_TAG_DATA    Names of enumerated tag data contents\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONALIZATION\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe libexif translations are made by volunteers working on their own,\r\neither directly with the libexif project or through one of two translation\r\ncoordination sites, the Translation Project\r\n<http://translationproject.org/domain/libexif.html> and Launchpad\r\n<https://translations.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+source/libexif/+pots/libexif-12>.\r\nAny updates to language translations coordinated by the Translation Project\r\nmust be made through their web site, but all other languages can be\r\nupdated either through Launchpad (preferred) or by sending updates to\r\nthe libexif developers mailing list directly.  As of this writing, the\r\nfollowing languages must be updated through the Translation Project:\r\ncs da de es fr it ja nl pl sk sv uk vi\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in translating libexif into a new language, we\r\nrecommend that you join one of the above translation groups and take\r\nadvantage of the systems they have built to help you.  A translation\r\ndisclaimer is NOT required for libexif at the Translation Project; by making\r\na translation, you agree implicitly to provide it under the same license\r\nterms as the rest of libexif (LGPL).\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORS\r\n-------\r\n\r\nlibexif has originally been written by Curtis Galloway\r\n<curtisg@users.sourceforge.net>. Because of the original design not\r\nsupporting editing and saving, Lutz Mueller <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>\r\nrewrote libexif from scratch. Since then, many more people have contributed\r\nto libexif.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINKS\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSome links you might want to check out if you are interested in further\r\ninformation about EXIF.\r\n\r\n - http://drewnoakes.com/code/exif: metadata extraction framework in Java\r\n - http://www.exif.org: information about the EXIF standard.\r\n - http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/TagNames/index.html: Looks\r\n   like libexif in Perl.
